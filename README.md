Inflation Dynamics, Output Gaps, and State-Level Economic Indicators

I have investigated the impact of domestic and global output gaps on CPI inflation in India, employing a New-Keynesian Phillips curve framework.

The methodology used was the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter to calculate output gaps, and applied Multiple Linear Regression with Quadratic & Cubic NEER estimates

Findings: Significant impact of crude oil prices and NEER on CPI inflation pre-crisis and in the full sample, with reduced impact post-crisis; model reliability confirmed by F-statistic significance (< 0.05).
